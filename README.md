# 📊 Job Market Trend

_A Machine Learning project for personal use_

---

## Overview

Welcome! This repository contains my exploration of **job market trends** using data science and machine learning techniques. As part of my learning journey at University Politehnica Bucharest (Industrial Engineering & Robotics), I created this project to practice working with data, build ML models, and gain insights into the ever-evolving job market.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Analyze and visualize job market data
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms
- Practice working with Jupyter Notebooks and Python
- Document my process so others can learn from it too

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** (main development environment)
- **Python** (data manipulation, modeling)
- Popular libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and more
